# Fun-Size-Portfolio-Edition
An abbreviated version of the game for portfolio presentation purposes. 
This will only be updated every so often, usually to introduce a fix or new feature after it is complete.
The pertinent code is located within the CPP_WIPICharacter .h and .cpp files, but the other C++ classes do contain code that you may find interesting. 
If you see any way to improve my code (more elegant solutions, better performance, etc), please let me know in the discussion or issues. 
I'm still teaching myself C++, so any guidance is greatly appreciated.
